        "A lot of what we do comes down to manipulating strings. Unfortunately, this isn't a thing computers are particularly efficient at.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike math, where we can parallelize a lot of operations, string manipulation is sequential. It often involves iterating over something one character at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "`str.replace()` is a good example of this. It's a very useful function, but it's not very efficient. It has to iterate over the string, and for each character it has to check if it matches the character it's looking for, and if it does, it has to copy the rest of the string over to a new string.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think a bit about how you'd implement most string functions, and you'll see it's virtually impossible to do anything other than go one character at a time.\n",
        "\n",
